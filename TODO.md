# AssessmentSphere Multi-Tenant Implementation TODO

1. Database Setup:
   - [x] Create the `tenants` table in Supabase
   - [x] Add `parent_id` and `type` fields to the `tenants` table
   - [x] Create the `users` table with tenant_id and role fields
   - [x] Create the `assessments` table
   - [x] Create the `questions` table
   - [x] Create the `assessment_results` table

2. Supabase Type Definitions:
   - [x] Update `lib/database.types.ts` to reflect the new table structures

3. Tenant Management:
   - [x] Implement a function to create new tenants (for onboarding process)
   - [ ] Create an admin interface for managing tenants (CRUD operations)

4. Authentication:
   - [x] Implement Supabase authentication
   - [x] Create auth context and hooks for managing user state
   - [x] Create sign-up and login pages using Supabase auth
   - [ ] Add password reset functionality
   - [ ] Modify authentication flow to associate users with tenants

5. Middleware and Routing:
   - [ ] Implement middleware for subdomain handling
   - [ ] Enhance middleware to support tenant hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
   - [ ] Test the middleware with various subdomain scenarios
   - [ ] Implement error handling for invalid subdomains

6. User Interface:
   - [x] Create a basic layout component
   - [ ] Implement tenant-specific dashboards (individual, school, district)

7. Data Access and Permissions:
   - [ ] Implement logic to scope data queries based on tenant hierarchy
   - [ ] Create role-based access control for different user types within a tenant

8. Assessment Functionality:
   - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for assessments
   - [ ] Create UI for building assessments (adding questions, options, etc.)
   - [ ] Develop assessment taking interface for users
   - [ ] Implement assessment scoring and result storage

9. Testing:
   - [ ] Write unit tests for core functions

10. Documentation:
    - [ ] Document the multi-tenant architecture and data model
    - [ ] Create user guides for tenant administrators

11. Deployment:
    - [ ] Set up staging environment with multi-tenant support
    - [ ] Configure production environment for multi-tenant deployment

Next steps:
1. Debug and fix the signup functionality
2. Implement proper error handling for authentication processes
3. Begin testing the subdomain creation and user signup processes
4. Start implementing subdomain routing middleware
5. Design and develop tenant-specific dashboards

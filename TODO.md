# AssessmentSphere Multi-Tenant Implementation TODO

1. Database Setup:
   - [ ] Create the `tenants` table in Supabase with the updated structure (including parent_id and type fields)
   - [ ] Modify the `users` table to include tenant_id and role fields

2. Supabase Type Definitions:
   - [ ] Update `lib/database.types.ts` to reflect the new `tenants` table structure

3. Tenant Management:
   - [ ] Implement a function to create new tenants (for onboarding process)
   - [ ] Create an admin interface for managing tenants (CRUD operations)

4. Authentication:
   - [ ] Implement Supabase authentication
   - [ ] Create sign-up and login pages
   - [ ] Modify authentication flow to associate users with tenants

6. User Interface:
   - [ ] Create a layout component that adapts based on tenant type
   - [ ] Implement tenant-specific dashboards (individual, school, district)

7. Data Access and Permissions:
   - [ ] Implement logic to scope data queries based on tenant hierarchy
   - [ ] Create role-based access control for different user types within a tenant

8. Testing:
   - [ ] Write unit tests for getTenant function and middleware
   - [ ] Set up integration tests for multi-tenant scenarios

9. Documentation:
   - [ ] Document the multi-tenant architecture and data model
   - [ ] Create user guides for tenant administrators

10. Deployment:
    - [ ] Set up staging environment with multi-tenant support
    - [ ] Configure production environment for multi-tenant deployment

Next immediate steps:
1. Implement the `tenants` table in Supabase
2. Update the Supabase type definitions
3. Begin work on tenant creation and management functions
